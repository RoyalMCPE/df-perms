# Df-perms (Working title)

DF-Perms is a work in progress permissions manager for [Dragonfly](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly).

# Roadmap
 - [ ] Command parser: Allow commands, subcommand and arguments to define their permission levels/tags and reflect them in the command preview. 
 - [ ] Event Parser: Using [peex](https://github.com/AndreasHGK/Peex) to allow handlers to define what events should be executed based on permission level and tag.
 - [ ] Web Editor: A web editor for admins to update tags and levels for players and groups. Can be enabled/disabled through config.
